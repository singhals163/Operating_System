## Study Material

This directory contains most of the study material I went through during the course. Note, this is not limited and there may be a lot of other resources that one might need to consider, but the enclosed ones constitute the majority.

- [examples](./examples/) contains some programs showing intricacies about how the OS might not behave the way you expect it to be. Try to guess their solutions before running them, such questions may be asked in quizzes or exams
- [Notes](./Notes/) contain the class notes by the instructor
- Rest all markdowns contains my version of notes compiled from OSTEP and class notes and some other resources
- [Practice problems](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/os/) contains some good questions on the lines of the ones asked in exams
