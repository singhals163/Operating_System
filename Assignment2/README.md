## Assignment 2
This directory contains my implementation for Assignment 2. The task were the following:
- create a trace buffer to store information of a syscall of function to be traced which can only be operated in kernel mode
- implement strace functionality for tracing system calls made by the program
- implement ftrace functionality for tracing function calls (added to being traced) made by the program

To run the program setup the environment using these guidelines:
1) Please follow the steps mentioned in the following document/video to prepare the setup required for assignment 2.
